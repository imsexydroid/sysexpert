The idea\n  is that the central stock exchange is the platform that actually executes\n  stock trades, whereas the stockbroker is just the platform that customers talk\n  to when they want to place a trade--the stock brokerage is \"simpler\" and more\n  \"human-readable\", so to speak.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  We only care about supporting market trades--trades that are executed at the\n  current stock price--and we can assume that our system stores customer\n  balances (i.e., funds that customers may have previously deposited) in a\n  SQL table.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  We need to design a <i>PlaceTrade</i> API call, and we know that the central\n  exchange's equivalent API method will take in a callback that's guaranteed to\n  be executed upon completion of a call to that API method.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  We're designing this system to support millions of trades per day coming from\n  millions of customers in a single region (the U.S., for example).

The\n  idea is to use a message queue like Apache Kafka or Google Cloud Pub/Sub and\n  to have a set of topics that customer ids map to. This gives us at-least-once\n  delivery semantics to make sure that we don't miss new trades. When a customer\n  makes a trade, the API server writes a row to the database and also creates a\n  message that gets routed to a topic for that customer (using hashing),\n  notifying the topic's subscriber that there's a new trade.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  This gives us a guarantee that for a single customer, we only have a single\n  thread trying to execute their trades at any time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Subscribers of topics can be rings of 3 workers (clusters of\n  servers, essentially) that use leader election to have 1 master worker do the\n  work for the cluster (this is for our system's high availability)--the leader\n  grabs messages as they get pushed to the topic and executes the trades for the\n  customers contained in the messages by calling the exchange. As mentioned\n  above, a single customer's trades are only ever handled by the same cluster of\n  workers, which makes our logic and our SQL queries cleaner.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  As far as how many topics and clusters of workers we'll need, we can do some rough estimation. If we\n  plan to execute millions of trades per day, that comes down to about 10-100\n  trades per second given open trading hours during a third of a day and\n  non-uniform trading patterns. If we assume that the core execution logic lasts\n  about a second, then we should have roughly 10-100 topics and clusters of workers to process trades in\n  parallel.\n</p>\n<pre>\n~100,000 seconds per day (3600 * 24)\n~1,000,000 trades per day\ntrades bunched in 1/3rd of the day\n--> (1,000,000 / 100,000) * 3 = ~30 trades per second\n</pre>"

A market order means that, given a placed order to buy or sell a stock, we should try to execute the order as soon as possible regardless of the stock price.

            "answer": "Yes, the exchange has an API, and your platform's API (the PlaceTrade call) will have to interact with the exchange's API. As far as that's concerned, you can assume that the call to the exchange to make an actual trade will take in a callback (in addition to the info about the trade) that will get executed when that trade completes at the exchange level (meaning, when the trade either gets FILLED or REJECTED, this callback will be executed). You can also assume that the exchange's system is highly available--your callback will always get executed at least once."
