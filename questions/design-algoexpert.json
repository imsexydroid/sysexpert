We probably don't need more than two or three nines, because\n  we're not building a health or security system, and this gets us somewhere\n  between <b>8 hours and 3 days</b> of downtime per year, which is reasonable.\n  All in all, this means that we don't need to worry <i>too</i> much about\n  availability.\n</p>\n<p>\n  We care about latency and throughput within reason, but apart from the\n  code-execution engine, this doesn't seem like a particularly difficult aspect\n  of our system.\n</p>"

On the other hand,\n  AlgoExpert isn't <i>just</i> a static website; it clearly has a lot of dynamic\n  content that users themselves can generate (code that they can write, for\n  example). So we'll need to have a robust API backing our UI, and given that\n  user content gets saved on the website, we'll also need a database backing our\n  API.\n</p>\n<p>\n  We can divide our system into 3 core components:\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Static UI content</li>\n  <li>\n    Accessing and interacting with questions (question completion status,\n    saving solutions, etc.)\n  </li>\n  <li>Ability to run code</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\n  Note that the second bullet point will likely get further divided.\n</p>"

We can limit the number of code runs to once every second, 3 times\n  per 5 seconds, and 5 times per minute. This will prevent DoS attacks through\n  the code-execution API, but it'll still allow for a good user experience when\n  running code.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Since we want 1-3 seconds of latency for running code, we need to keep a set\n  of special servers--our \"workers\"-- ready to run code at all times. They can\n  each clean up after running user code (remove extra generated files as a\n  result of compilation, for example) so that they don\u2019t need to be killed at\n  any point. Our backend servers can contact a free worker and get the response\n  from that worker when it's done running code (or if the code timed out), and\n  our servers can return that to the UI in the same request.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Given that certain languages need to be compiled, we can estimate that it\n  would take on average 1 second to compile and run the code for each language.\n  People don\u2019t run code that often, so we can expect 10 run-codes per second in\n  total given roughly 10,000 users on the website at once, so we'll probably\n  need 10-100 machines to satisfy our original latency requirement of 1-3\n  seconds per run-code (10 machines if 10 run-codes per second is accurate, more\n  if we experience higher load).\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  This design scales horizontally with our number of users, and it can scale\n  vertically to make running code even faster (more CPU == faster runs).\n</p>\n<p>\n  Lastly, we can have some logging and monitoring in our system, especially for\n  running code (tracking run-code events per language, per user, per question,\n  average response time, etc.). This will help us automatically scale our\n  clusters when user demand goes up or down. This can also be useful to know if\n  any malicious behavior is happening with the code-execution engine.\n</p>"
