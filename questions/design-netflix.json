Let's start by estimating how much space we'll need.\n</p>\n<p>\n  We were told that Netflix has about 200 million users; we can make a few\n  assumptions about other Netflix metrics (alternatively, we can ask our\n  interviewer for guidance here):\n</p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Netflix offers roughly 10 thousand movies and shows at any given time</li>\n  <li>\n    Since movies can be up to 2+ hours in length and shows tend to be between 20\n    and 40 minutes per episode, we can assume an average video length of 1 hour\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    Each movie / show will have a <b>Standard Definition</b> version and a\n    <b>High Definition</b>\n    version. Per hour, SD will take up about 10GB of space, while HD will take\n    about 20GB.\n  </li>\n</ul>\n<pre>\n~10K videos (stored in SD & HD)\n~1 hour average video length\n~10 GB/h for SD + ~20 GB/h for HD = 30 GB/h per video\n~30 GB/h * 10K videos = 300,000 GB = 300 TB\n</pre>\n<p>\n  This number highlights the importance of estimations. Naively, one might think\n  that Netflix stores many petabytes of video, since its core product revolves\n  around video content; but a simple back-of-the-napkin estimation shows us that\n  it actually stores a very modest amount of video.\n</p>\n<p>\n  This is because Netflix, unlike other servies like YouTube, Google Drive, and\n  Facebook, has a bounded amount of video content: the movies and shows that it\n  offers; those other services allow users to upload unlimited amounts of video.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since we're only dealing with a few hundred terabytes of data, we can use a\n  simple blob storage solution like <b>S3</b> or <b>GCS</b> to reliably handle\n  the storage and replication of Netflix's video content; we don't need a more\n  complex data-storage solution.\n</p>"

For instance, we might want to store the timestamp that a user left\n  a video at, a user's rating on a video, etc..\n</p>\n<p>\n  Just like the static content mentioned above, this user metadata will be tied\n  to the number of videos on Netflix. However, unlike the static content, this\n  user metadata will grow with the Netflix userbase, since each user will have\n  user metadata.\n</p>\n<p>We can quickly estimate how much space we'll need for this user metadata:</p>\n<pre>\n  ~200M users\n  ~1K videos watched per user per lifetime (~10% of total content)\n  ~100 bytes/video/user\n  ~100 bytes * 1K videos * 200M users = 100 KB * 200M = 1 GB * 20K = 20 TB\n</pre>\n<p>\n  Perhaps surprisingly, we'll be storing an amount of user metadata in the same\n  ballpark as the amount of video content that we'll be storing. Once again,\n  this is because of the bounded nature of Netflix's video content, which is in\n  stark contrast with the unbounded nature of its userbase.\n</p>\n<p>\n  We'll likely need to query this metadata, so storing it in a classic\n  relational database like Postgres makes sense.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since Netflix users are effectively isolated from one another (they aren't\n  connected like they would be on a social-media platform, for example), we can\n  expect all of our latency-sensitive database operations to only relate to\n  individual users. In other words, potential operations like\n  <i>GetUserInfo</i> and <i>GetUserWatchedVideos</i>, which would require fast\n  latencies, are specific to a particular users; on the other hand, complicated\n  database operations involving multiple users' metadata will likely be part of\n  background data-engineering jobs that don't care about latency.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Given this, we can split our user-metadata database into a handful of shards,\n  each managing anywhere between 1 and 10 TB of indexed data. This will maintain\n  very quick reads and writes for a given user.\n</p>"

We\n  need many thousands of locations around the world to be distributing this\n  content for us. Thankfully, <b>CDN</b>s solve this precise problem, since they\n  have many thousands of <b>Points of Presence</b> around the world. We can thus\n  use a CDN like Cloudflare and serve our video content out of the CDN's PoPs.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Since the PoPs can't keep the entirety of Netflix's video content in cache, we\n  can have an external service that periodically repopulates CDN PoPs with the\n  most important content (the movies and shows most likely to be watched).\n</p>"
