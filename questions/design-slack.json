To support this, we'll need a\n  persistent storage solution.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Specifically, we'll opt for a SQL database since we can expect this data to be\n  structured and to be queried frequently.\n</p>\n<p>We can start with a simple table that'll store every Slack channel.</p>\n<p><b>Channels</b></p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id (channelId): <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>orgId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>name: <i>string</i></th>\n      <th>description: <i>string</i></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>\n  Then, we can have another simple table representing channel-member pairs: each\n  row in this table will correspond to a particular user who is in a particular\n  channel. We'll use this table, along with the one above, to fetch a user's\n  relevant when the app loads.\n</p>\n<p><b>Channel Members</b></p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>orgId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>channelId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>userId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>\n  We'll naturally need a table to store all historical messages sent on Slack.\n  This will be our largest table, and it'll be queried every time a user fetches\n  messages in a particular channel. The API endpoint that'll interact with this\n  table will return a paginated response, since we'll typically only want the 50\n  or 100 most recent messages per channel.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Also, this table will only be queried when a user clicks on a channel; we\n  don't want to fetch messages for all of a user's channels on app load, since\n  users will likely never look at most of their channels.\n</p>\n<p><b>Historical Messages</b></p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>orgId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>channelId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>senderId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>sentAt: <i>timestamp</i></th>\n      <th>body: <i>string</i></th>\n      <th>mentions: <i>List&lt;uuid&gt;</i></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>\n  In order not to fetch recent messages for every channel on app load, all the\n  while supporting the feature of showing which channels have unread messages,\n  we'll need to store two extra tables: one for the latest activity in each\n  channel (this table will be updated whenever a user sends a message in a\n  channel), and one for the last time a particular user has read a channel (this\n  table will be updated whenever a user opens a channel).\n</p>\n<p><b>Latest Channel Timestamps</b></p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>orgId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>channelId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>lastActive: <i>timestamp</i></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p><b>Channel Read Receipts</b></p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>orgId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>channelId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>userId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>lastSeen: <i>timestamp</i></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>\n  For the number of unread user mentions that we want to display next to channel\n  names, we'll have another table similar to the read-receipts one, except this\n  one will have a count of unread user mentions instead of a timestamp. This\n  count will be updated (incremented) whenever a user tags another user in a\n  channel message, and it'll also be updated (reset to 0) whenever a user opens\n  a channel with unread mentions of themself.\n</p>\n<p><b>Unread Channel-User-Mention Counts</b></p>\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>id: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>orgId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>channelId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>userId: <i>uuid</i></th>\n      <th>count: <i>int</i></th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n      <td>...</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<p></p>"

Some organizations might\n  double in size overnight, others might experience seemingly random surges of\n  activity, etc.. This means that, despite our relatively sound sharding\n  strategy, we might still run into hot spots, which is very bad considering the\n  fact that we care about latency so much.\n</p>\n<p>\n  To handle this, we can add a \"smart\" sharding solution: a subsystem of our\n  system that'll asynchronously measure organization activity and \"rebalance\"\n  shards accordingly. This service can be a strongly consistent key-value store\n  like Etcd or ZooKeeper, mapping orgIds to shards. Our API servers will\n  communicate with this service to know which shard to route requests to.\n</p>"

            "question": "There are a lot of things that you can do on Slack. Primarily, you use Slack to communicate with people in one-on-one channels, private channels, or public channels, all within an organization. But you can also do a bunch of other things on Slack, like create and delete channels, change channel settings, change Slack settings, invite people to channels, etc.. What exactly are we designing here?",
            "answer": "We're designing the core messaging functionality, which involves communicating in both one-on-one channels and group channels in an organization. You don't have to worry about channel settings and all of those extra functionalities."
        },
        {
            "question": "Okay. Do you want me to take care of the concept of private channels at all?",

        },
        {
            "question": "Okay. And regarding communication, from my knowledge of Slack, when you load the web app or the desktop / mobile apps, you can obviously access all the messages of channels that you're in (including one-on-one channels), but you're also notified of channels that have unread messages for you and of the number of unread mentions that you have in each channel. Channels with unread messages are bold, if I remember correctly, and the number of unread mentions is simply visible next to channel names. Should we design our system to accommodate this?",
            "answer": "Yes, we should take care of this. And on that note, one thing we'll want to handle is cross-device synchronization. In other words, if you have both the Slack desktop app and the Slack mobile app open, and both apps are showing that one channel is unread, and you read that channel on one of the apps, the other app should immediately get updated and should mark the channel as read. You'll have to handle this."
        },
        {
            "question": "Hmm, okay. Speaking of different applications, by the way, are we designing the various device / software apps, or just the backend systems that the frontends / clients communicate with?",

        {
            "question": "Okay. Also, there are a lot of different features in actual Slack messages. For example, adding custom emojis, pinning messages, saving messages, writing code snippets or text-blocks, etc.. Do you want me to handle all of this?",
            "answer": "No, you can just treat messages as pure text for now. Of course, what you'll design will likely be extensible to different types of messages and will eventually be able to handle things like pinning or saving messages, but for this design, don't worry about that."

And as for organizations, let's say that the largest single Slack customer has 50,000 people in the same organization. We can also approximate that the largest channel will be of that same size if all of an organization's employees are in the same channel (the typical #general channel, for example)."
        },
        {
            "question": "Since this is a chat application, I'm assuming that low latency is one of our top priorities, and also, since this service impacts millions of users, I'm assuming that we should design with high availability in mind. Are these correct assumptions?",
            "answer": "Yes to both of those things, but for the sake of being a little more focused, don't worry about optimizing for availability. Let's focus primarily on latency and core functionality."

            "question": "Okay. And are we building this for a global audience, or should we focus on a single region?",
